# Introduction to Machine Learning: Fine Grained Image Classification

This is the repository for the Fine Grained Image Classification project for the Introduction to Machine Learning course at Msc Data Science at University of Trento

Each repository is dedicated to one of the four different methods that we decided to employ.

To train and test our models we utilized three datasets:

- Food101: a dataset consisting of 101 food categories, with 101000 images. For each class, 250 manually reviewed test images are provided as well as 750 training images. It can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dansbecker/food-101) or directly through the torchvision library.
- FGVC-Aircraft: a dataset that contains 10200 images of aircraft, with 100 images for each of 102 different aircraft model variants, most of which are airplanes. It can be found [here](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/fgvc-aircraft/) or directly through the torchvision library.
- NABirds: a collection of 48,000 annotated photographs of the 400 species of birds that are commonly observed in North America. More than 100 photographs are available for each species, including separate annotations for males, females and juveniles that comprise 700 visual categories. It can be downloaded [here](https://dl.allaboutbirds.org/nabirds)
