This scripts allow to train a DenseNet-121 on different datasets. To speed the training up the model starts from the default weight, that are pre-trained on imageNet. The default architecture is also modified to account for the different number of classes in the datasets.

The scripts automatically download the datasets and save them in a folder called 'data'. By simply running the file .py it is possible to see the model performing.
